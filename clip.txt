A small single-engine plane with three people aboard crashed in the northern suburbs of New York City Thursday — and the search was on to find the wreckage, officials said. 

The Beechcraft A36, which holds up to six passengers, went down around 6:15 p.m. after the pilot reported engine trouble about one mile from Westchester County Airport in White Plains, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 

The plane was on its way to Cuyahoga County Airport in Ohio from JFK Airport when the pilot lost contact with FAA officials around 5:30 p.m., officials said. 

Three people, including the pilot, were on board the aircraft, according to a Westchester County spokesperson. 

Local first responders were still searching for the plane hours later, the FAA said Thursday evening. 

The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident.

Westchester’s airport is roughly a 40-mile drive to JFK Airport.
